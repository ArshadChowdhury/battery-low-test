# XYZ Petroleum App

## In this project we wanna determine the maximum & minimum X, Y , Z from CSV file or from user input. If there's no CSV file present user can use input fields to provide values for the respective fields as well.

## To run this project locally after cloning it run ```yarn install``` in terminal and then after installing all the dependencies you have to run ```yarn dev``` to run the development server or you can run ```yarn build``` and then ```yarn start``` for production server.

## Then go to http://localhost:5173/ in your browser to see and test the project.

# Or you can go to https://xyz-petroleum.netlify.app/ to see the live site there.

## You can access a custom CSV list right here, all you have to do it download it from here and then upload in into our project - https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RD5fU_FN5DlnQCwo_TWPIFPzZAKDTzVa/view?usp=drive_link

## After uploading the CSV file we get to see the bar chart of the Maximum X value.

## Then finally after putting in all the values necessary you can download the result page as a pdf so it can be examined further. Also there's an add another project button in case you wanna add another project. Which will clear the first step info from localstorage and stop you to navigating directly http://localhost:5173/second-step or http://localhost:5173/result-page
