## To run this project first you must clone it and then run ```yarn install``` in terminal and then after installing all the dependencies you have to run ```yarn dev``` to run the development server and finally open up ```http://localhost:5173/``` to see the website as your dev server.

## In this prototype project we wanna determine the maximum & minimum X, Y , Z from CSV file or from user input. If there's no CSV file present user can use input fields to provide values for the respective fields as well.

## You can access a custom CSV list right here, all you have to do it download it from here and then upload in into our project - https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RD5fU_FN5DlnQCwo_TWPIFPzZAKDTzVa/view?usp=drive_link

## Then finally after putting in all the values necessary you can download the result page as a pdf so it can be examined further. Also there's an add another project button in case you wanna add another project.
