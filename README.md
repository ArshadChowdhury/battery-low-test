## To run this project locally after cloning it run ```yarn install``` in terminal and then after installing all the dependencies you have to run ```yarn dev``` to run the development server and finally open up ```http://localhost:5173/``` to see the website as your dev server or you can run ```yarn start``` for production server and go to ```http://localhost:5173/``` as well to see website as prod server.

# Or you can go to https://xyz-petroleum.netlify.app/ to see the live site there.

## In this prototype project we wanna determine the maximum & minimum X, Y , Z from CSV file or from user input. If there's no CSV file present user can use input fields to provide values for the respective fields as well.

## You can access a custom CSV list right here, all you have to do it download it from here and then upload in into our project - https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RD5fU_FN5DlnQCwo_TWPIFPzZAKDTzVa/view?usp=drive_link

## Then finally after putting in all the values necessary you can download the result page as a pdf so it can be examined further. Also there's an add another project button in case you wanna add another project. Which will clear the first step info from localstorage and stop you to navigating directly ```http://localhost:5173/second-step``` or ```http://localhost:5173/result-page```
